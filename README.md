# **Project description**

Dengue remains a global health challenge with limited treatment options, highlighting the need for effective vector control strategies. The introduction of Wolbachia pipientis into Aedes aegypti populations has shown success in reducing dengue transmission across global field trials. However, the spillover effectiveness of the technology on untreated areas is not well-known. This study estimates the spillover protective effectiveness (PE) of Wolbachia-mediated introgression on dengue using synthetic control under assumption of partial interference.
